#Project Overview
#This project implements a web application for detecting potato leaf diseases using Streamlit. It leverages machine learning techniques to provide farmers with quick and accurate disease identification, enhancing crop management.

#Objectives
#Disease Identification: Classify major potato leaf diseases such as Late Blight and Early Blight.
#User -Friendly Interface: Develop an intuitive web app for easy image uploads and instant results.
Methodology
Data Collection: Compile a dataset of healthy and diseased potato leaf images.
Preprocessing: Normalize and augment images for model training.
Model Development: Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification.
Deployment: Host the application using Streamlit and deploy on platforms like Heroku.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Streamlit
Deployment: Heroku for hosting the web application
Expected Outcomes
A reliable model for detecting potato leaf diseases.
An accessible web application for farmers to utilize in the field.
Future Work
Expand the model to include additional diseases.
Enhance the application with real-time detection features.
Conclusion
This project aims to support farmers in managing potato crops effectively, contributing to improved agricultural practices and food security. # Potato Leaf Disease Detection
